# ðŸ§ª Test Cases for Prompt-Driven Assistant Template

This folder contains working assistant configurations built using the **Prompt-Driven Assistant Template**.

Each `.md` file is a standalone configuration for a functional Prompt-Driven Assistant â€” ready to copy-paste into a Custom GPT, Claude, Gemini, or other compatible platform.

---

## âœ… How to Use

1. Open any `.md` file in this folder  
2. Copy the full assistant configuration  
3. Paste it into a Custom GPT builder or prompt-based interface  
4. Optionally tweak the mission, roles, lenses, or tone to fit your use case

These assistants follow the same logic and structure as defined in `template-GPT.md`.
