# 🧠 AI Assistant Template – Project Overview

A modular, multi-platform framework for designing and deploying advanced GPT-based assistants — optimized for creativity, strategic clarity, factual control, and iterative refinement.

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is a **design system for AI assistants**. It allows you to define, configure, and document GPT-based tools using:

- Roles (behavioral tone and function)
- Lenses (interpretive perspective)
- Drift Levels (literal to symbolic output)
- Output Modes (intent + flavor)
- Personality Modes (tone calibration)
- Bias & Fact-Check Control
- Structured Output Formats
- Collaboration, Testing, and Refinement

---

## 🛠️ What’s Included

### `template-GPT.md`
> The full prompt-based configuration file for building assistants.

- Editable assistant name, purpose, and role
- User input guidance
- Interpretive lenses and drift modes
- Personality and output structures
- Bias handling configuration
- Refinement loop and edge case handling
- Strategic enhancers and testing protocols
- Usage examples, presets, and customization checklist

### `README.md`
> Deployment-focused documentation for prompt engineers, builders, and contributors.

- Quick-start checklist
- Platform-specific notes (OpenAI GPTs, Claude, Gemini, Mistral)
- Configuration, customization, and prompt chaining guidance
- Usage examples and transformation demos
- Testing, validation, troubleshooting, and version history

---

## 🌐 What Platforms Does It Support?

- ✅ **OpenAI Custom GPTs** (8K limit workaround, instruction formatting, chaining)
- ✅ **Claude / Anthropic** (facing prompts with XML/Markdown separation)
- ✅ **Gemini, Mistral, LLaMA, or other LLMs** (via structure adaptation and iteration)
- 🧩 Compatible with multi-agent chains, RAG pipelines, and prompt chaining frameworks

---

## 🧪 Ideal Use Cases

- Strategic content generation
- Creative and symbolic outputs
- Branded assistant personalities
- Educational, reflective, or planning tools
- Role-diverse, multimodal, or multi-agent assistants
