# üß† AI Assistant Template ‚Äì README Overview

![Prompt-Driven AI Assistant Template Cover](prompt-driven-ai-assistant-template-cover.png)

**A modular, customizable framework for building advanced AI assistants‚Äîcompatible with OpenAI Custom GPTs, Claude, and other leading models.**

This modular framework helps you design powerful, strategic, and creative AI assistants using GPT or Claude.

It supports role-based behavior, drift-level creativity, bias control, and collaborative workflows.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get your assistant running:

1. Open `template-GPT.md` and define your assistant‚Äôs **name, purpose, and mission**.
2. Select your **roles, lenses, drift level, output modes**, and **bias/fact-check mode**.
3. Review the **output structure** and align examples and formats.
4. Choose your **platform** (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) and follow platform-specific setup.
5. Use the **Customization Checklist** and **Refinement Loop** for iteration.
6. Test, deploy, and adapt your assistant.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Platform-Specific Guidance

### **For OpenAI Custom GPTs**

- **Instructions Field Limit:** 8,000 characters (including spaces and line breaks).
- **Workarounds:**
    - **Move non-essential or reusable content** (detailed examples, presets, configuration notes) to the ‚ÄúKnowledge‚Äù section or to attached files.
    - **Use concise, modular instructions** in the main field, referencing external content for details.
    - **For large templates:** Split instructions into logical modules and reference them in the main prompt, or use a ‚Äúprompt chaining‚Äù approach. *Prompt chaining means breaking complex tasks into sequential steps, where each step‚Äôs output informs the next.*
- **Best Practices:**
    - **Define WHO, WHAT, and WHY** at the start of your instructions.
    - **Break down complex instructions** into clear steps, using delimiters and few-shot examples where needed.
    - **Specify output format and style** for consistency.
    - **Use Markdown formatting** for improved readability.


### **For Claude and Other Models (Facing Prompt)**

- **Prompt Structure:** Claude responds well to clear, structured prompts with explicit instructions and examples.
- **Best Practices:**
    - **Use XML or Markdown** to separate instructions, context, and examples.
    - **Assign a clear role** at the start (‚ÄúYou are a [role]...‚Äù) and specify the expected output format.
    - **Prefill the start of the assistant‚Äôs message** to control output structure and tone.
    - **Use prompt chaining or step-by-step instructions** for complex tasks.
    - **Claude‚Äôs context window is large** (up to 200,000 tokens), but keep prompts concise for clarity.
- **Adaptation Tips:**
    - **Remove or condense OpenAI-specific references.**
    - **Adjust formatting** if using XML tags for Claude.
    - **Test and iterate** to optimize for Claude‚Äôs conversational and analytical strengths.

*For other LLMs (e.g., Gemini, Mistral): Adapt the prompt structure as above, using clear instructions and examples. Test and adjust for each model‚Äôs strengths and quirks.*

## üìã Usage Examples

**OpenAI Custom GPT Example:**
`"Reposition this old product as a modern learning tool"`
‚Üí 3-option output + feasibility summary

**Claude Facing Prompt Example:**
`"You are a creative strategist. Use the Narrative Essence lens and Drift 3 to transform this product description into a compelling story. Output in Markdown."`
‚Üí Story output with specified lens and drift

*Before/After Example:*

- **Before:** `"Summarize this document."`
- **After:** `"Summarize this document using the Reflective Learning lens and Drift 2. Include key insights and actionable recommendations."`
‚Üí Summary with structured insights


## üß™ Testing \& Validation

## üö® Troubleshooting \& FAQ

**Q: What if my output is too vague?**
A: Use the Discovery Phase or request clarifying questions.

**Q: How do I ensure factual accuracy?**
A: Set Bias \& Fact-Check Mode to Strict and use Critical Reader role.

**Q: How can I adapt this for global audiences?**
A: Enable localization and internationalization guidelines.

**Q: How do I adapt the template for Claude?**
A: Use as a facing prompt, adjust formatting for XML or Markdown, and specify roles and output formats clearly.

**Q: What is prompt chaining?**
A: Prompt chaining is breaking complex tasks into sequential steps, where each step‚Äôs output informs the next.
